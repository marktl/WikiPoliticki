WikiPoliticki.us - This project was created to fill a need in providing transparency and accountability to elected government officials.  The hope is to provide a single page view of either elected officials or canidates based on user location with some basic information on each official/canidate along with api connections to facebook and google news giving users a place to see current information and discuss with friends in an easy way.  Any help with this project is very much appreciated!  email levymt@gmail.com to reach me.
